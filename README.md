# Mirage.Generations
 Mirage Generations is a recreation of the Mirage Source game engine created in .NET Core and C#.

## What is Mirage Generations?
 Mirage Generations is my recration of the old Murage Source engine but using newer design principles and software frameworks. My goal is for the engine to be as modular as possible so people can decide for themselves what features they do or do not want added into their games.
 
## What are my goals with this project?
 As stated above I want to recreate the feel and features of Mirage Source but have it be as modular as possible. One of my biggest complaints with the old version in basic was that everything was so tightly integrated trying to remove or change one thing often resulted in the whole engine imploding. This will not be happening in this version, and I will actually deny any commits that don't follow this idea. A general rule is that if something doesn't follow the SOLID design principles it will be denied.
 
 Furthermore I will not be restricting what languages people decide to develop things in for the engine. I would prefer C# code, as that is what I will be coding the primary projects in, but if someone wants to develop an addition and have it added to the main repository I wil not deny the commits soley based on that reason.
 
 At some point I will be adding in a folder with design docs and other explantions of things, please review them before submitting pull requests to ensure any changes you wish to make are in compliance with the engine's design principles.

## Disclaimer
 I do programming as a side hobby and can not commit all of my time to it. I also have my own personal projects that I want to work on to slot into the time I can allot for this hobby. While I personally love to work on community projects and help others, for these reasons I can not spend all of my time working on Mirage Generations and progress may seem slow at times. I am open to other people forking and helping develop the code but please keep in mind the goals and design patterns I am using when making changes.
